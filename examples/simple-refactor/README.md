# Simple Refactor Example

This example demonstrates how to use Coding Swarm to refactor a specific part of your codebase.

## Setup

1. Copy the `swarm.yaml` to your project root.
2. Edit the `repo_path` and `test_command` to match your target module.
3. Run `swarm launch`.

## Agent Roles

- **Code Reviewers**: Will scan the code, identify issues, and refactor them.
- **Test Writer**: Will ensure tests cover the new changes.
