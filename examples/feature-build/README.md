# Feature Build Example

This example demonstrates how to use Coding Swarm to implement a net-new feature.

## Strategy

- **Generalists**: Do the heavy lifting of implementation.
- **Test Writers**: Keep test coverage high as new code is added.
- **Optimizer**: Ensures the new feature is performant from the start.

## Usage

1. Initialize a new branch: `git checkout -b feature/my-feature`
2. Launch the swarm: `swarm launch`
